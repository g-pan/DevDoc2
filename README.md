### A Level III Heading 
This is a development site for proof of concept of hosting the readme.md files located on our GitHub Repository by enabling GitHub Pages and configuring the pages to display the readme content as a web page. Using GitHub Pages allows us to apply templates to format the readme pages by declaring which template to use this page is rendered using the "leap-day" theme. 
Alternatively you can choose to use an HTML file or files as your GitHub Pages - simply by configuring the GitHub Pages to use a specified HTML file. If you own the repo the naming convention will be <your_username>.github.io/<Repo_Name>  for example my username is g-pan and this repo is DevDoc2. This url is g-pan.github.io/DevDoc2
